"Zuca, Brazuca",Portugal,Brazilians,"Short for Brazuca, derived from ""Brasil"", used by Portuguese people to refer to Brazilians living in Portugal.",
"Zhyd, zhid, zhydovka, zhidovka",East Slavic language speakers,Jewish people,"Originally neutral (as in other Slavic languages), but became pejorative as debate over the Jewish question and the antisemitism in the Russian Empire intensified in the end of the 19th century. While still in official use during the Ukrainian War of Independence and the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic, its use was banned by the Soviet authorities, which had previously been campaigning against its usage, in the 1930s. The usage of the word ""żyd"" in Polish depends on capitalisation and grammatical form: upper-case Żyd is neutral and denotes Jews in general or Jews as a nationality; the lower-case form (żyd, plural: żydzi) denotes a follower of Judaism and, while neutral, is discouraged as it may be confused with the insult ""żyd"" (plural: żydy), referring to Jews themselves or to greedy people, or both.",
