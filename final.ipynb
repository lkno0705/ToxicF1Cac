    "## Introduction\n",
    "Formula 1 is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars and is generally considered the most competitive, fastest and hardest class of motor racing. Since it’s first season in 1950, Formula 1 is visiting a diverse list of many different countries, where the best drivers in the world are racing against each other in teams of two drivers to determine the best driver and the best team on the Formula 1 grid [@about_f1]. These events are visited by thousands of Fans, with millions more following them on television and social media. With the 2021 season being one of the closest and most entertaining seasons in the history of Formula 1, where Red Bulls Max Verstappen beat Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton in the grand finale of the season under controversial circumstances after a full season of controversy, drama and intense on track battles and with the release of Netflix Drive To Survive, Formula 1s popularity is growing rapidly. But, reports of Toxic and abusive Fan behavior at events and in comment sections on social media are accumulating, and casts an ugly shadow over Formula 1s latest successes [@woodhouse_scary_2022].\n",
    "As the reports over toxic and abusive fan behaviours in social media and at live events are rising, Formula 1 as well as Fans and drivers are taking a stand against toxicity in the Formula 1 community. However, an independent and scientific analysis of this topic is missing and therefore the accusations are sort of hanging in the air without a solid scientific foundation. Therefore, in order to tackle this problem research into the toxicity of Formula 1 fandom is a necassety to gain valuable insights into understanding the problem, where it originates from and to build a foundation for future measures to make attending Formula 1 events as well as the media around it a safer and more enjoyable experience. To take the first step into this direction, this thesis will analyse Youtube comments of the Formula 1 channel in order to determine:\n",

    "## Fundamentals\n",
    "In this chapter the necessary fundamental knowledge is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula 1\n",
    "Formula 1 is the worlds most prestigous motor racing competition, as well as the world's most popular annual sporting series [@about_f1]. It marks the highest class of international open-wheel single-seater formula racing. The first Formula 1 competition was held in 1950, since then the competiton for the world drivers championship (wdc) which determines the worlds best driver and the world constructors championship (wcc) which determines the best team, is held annualy and is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). During the competition (also called a season), Formula 1 visits a variety of different countries and racing tracks, each event (Grands Prix) is attended by thousands of people with millions watching from home [@formula_1_2023]. All rights of the Formula 1 brand and the competition itself is owned by Formula One World Championship Limited, which is a corporation, that provides media distribution and promotion services, besides that, it controls the contracts, distribtution, and commercial management of rights and licenses of formula 1 [@formula_1_limited_company_profile]. The term Formula 1 is used to describe the corporation, as well as the competition, as they can't exist without each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Fandom\n",
    "According to Cornel Sandvoss Fandom is a community of people that are regularly, consuming a given popular narrative or text with great emotional involvement [@toxic_fandom]. The members of the community are called fans, which is a short form of \"fanatic\" [@arouh_toxic_2020]. In other words, a fandom is a community of people that are fanatic about a popular narrative or text such as a tv series, movie franchise or sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming a fan starts with the adoption of a fan identity about a fan object, thus fandom can be a powerful of defining the self. The fan object can be anything that people can be fanatic about, this may be a simple object such as trains or a virtual asset such as a movie franchise. Therefore, by taking part in a fandom, people are expressing themselfs through an identity they've chosen for themselfs. As a result, fans may lead to see the fan object as an extension of themselfs and thus react personally threatened if the fan object is facing a threat such as accusations etc [@toxic_fandom]. In addition to creating a strong part of their own identity, fans feel more connected or socialised through their fandom, as studies indicate, that even if fans don't interact with other members of a fan community, they still perceive themselfs as part of that community. Because of that, fans not only become personally invested in their fandom, they become socially invested as well [@toxic_fandom].\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the strong connection fans build up to their fan object, the time-frame in which this self identity has been chosen is also playing a role. As an example, many people build a fandom in their childhood about a tv series, franchise or sport, this often leads to them feeling entitled to having their fan object preserved as they deem acceptable. This behaviour is also called fan entitlement. A good example for this behaviour are the news movies and series in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars franchises, as most fan communities of these franchises have been outraged about the new characters and story lines, where many people claimed that this \"ruined their childhood\" [@toxic_fandom].\n",
    "\n",
    "From an economic point of view, fandom and fan cultures are seen as the ideal costumers. They are eager to get their hands on the newest products and they are stable with re-occuring purchases, since intense consumption is considered a part of the fan identity [@arouh_toxic_2020].\n",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the Grievance Dictionary, a psycholinguistic dictionary that can be used to automatically understand language use in the context of grievance-fueled violence threat assessment. We describe the development of the dictionary, which was informed by suggestions from experienced threat assessment practitioners. These suggestions and subsequent human and computational word list generation resulted in a dictionary of 20,502 words annotated by 2318 participants. The dictionary was validated by applying it to texts written by violent and non-violent individuals, showing strong evidence for a difference between populations in several dictionary categories. Further classification tasks showed promising performance, but future improvements are still needed. Finally, we provide instructions and suggestions for the use of the Grievance Dictionary by security professionals and (violence) researchers.",
