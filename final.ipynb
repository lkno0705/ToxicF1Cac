    "## Introduction\n",
    "Formula 1 is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars and is generally considered the most competitive, fastest and hardest class of motor racing. Since it’s first season in 1950, Formula 1 is visiting a diverse list of many different countries, where the best drivers in the world are racing against each other in teams of two drivers to determine the best driver and the best team on the Formula 1 grid [@about_f1]. These events are visited by thousands of Fans, with millions more following them on television and social media. With the 2021 season being one of the closest and most entertaining seasons in the history of Formula 1, where Red Bulls Max Verstappen beat Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton in the grand finale of the season under controversial circumstances after a full season of controversy, drama and intense on track battles and with the release of Netflix Drive To Survive, Formula 1s popularity is growing rapidly. But, reports of Toxic and abusive Fan behavior at events and in comment sections on social media are accumulating, and casts an ugly shadow over Formula 1s latest successes [@woodhouse_scary_2022].\n",
    "As the reports over toxic and abusive fan behaviours in social media and at live events are rising, Formula 1 as well as Fans and drivers are taking a stand against toxicity in the Formula 1 community. However, an independent and scientific analysis of this topic is missing and therefore the accusations are sort of hanging in the air without a solid scientific foundation. Therefore, in order to tackle this problem research into the toxicity of Formula 1 fandom is a necassety to gain valuable insights into understanding the problem, where it originates from and to build a foundation for future measures to make attending Formula 1 events as well as the media around it a safer and more enjoyable experience. To take the first step into this direction, this thesis will analyse Youtube comments of the Formula 1 channel in order to determine:\n",

    "## Fundamentals\n",
    "In this chapter the necessary fundamental knowledge is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula 1\n",
    "Formula 1 is the worlds most prestigous motor racing competition, as well as the world's most popular annual sporting series [@about_f1]. It marks the highest class of international open-wheel single-seater formula racing. The first Formula 1 competition was held in 1950, since then the competiton for the world drivers championship (wdc) which determines the worlds best driver and the world constructors championship (wcc) which determines the best team, is held annualy and is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). During the competition (also called a season), Formula 1 visits a variety of different countries and racing tracks, each event (Grands Prix) is attended by thousands of people with millions watching from home [@formula_1_2023]. All rights of the Formula 1 brand and the competition itself is owned by Formula One World Championship Limited, which is a corporation, that provides media distribution and promotion services, besides that, it controls the contracts, distribtution, and commercial management of rights and licenses of formula 1 [@formula_1_limited_company_profile]. The term Formula 1 is used to describe the corporation, as well as the competition, as they can't exist without each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Fandom\n",
    "According to Cornel Sandvoss Fandom is a community of people that are regularly, consuming a given popular narrative or text with great emotional involvement [@toxic_fandom]. The members of the community are called fans, which is a short form of \"fanatic\" [@arouh_toxic_2020]. In other words, a fandom is a community of people that are fanatic about a popular narrative or text such as a tv series, movie franchise or sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming a fan starts with the adoption of a fan identity about a fan object, thus fandom can be a powerful of defining the self. The fan object can be anything that people can be fanatic about, this may be a simple object such as trains or a virtual asset such as a movie franchise. Therefore, by taking part in a fandom, people are expressing themselfs through an identity they've chosen for themselfs. As a result, fans may lead to see the fan object as an extension of themselfs and thus react personally threatened if the fan object is facing a threat such as accusations etc [@toxic_fandom]. In addition to creating a strong part of their own identity, fans feel more connected or socialised through their fandom, as studies indicate, that even if fans don't interact with other members of a fan community, they still perceive themselfs as part of that community. Because of that, fans not only become personally invested in their fandom, they become socially invested as well [@toxic_fandom].\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the strong connection fans build up to their fan object, the time-frame in which this self identity has been chosen is also playing a role. As an example, many people build a fandom in their childhood about a tv series, franchise or sport, this often leads to them feeling entitled to having their fan object preserved as they deem acceptable. This behaviour is also called fan entitlement. A good example for this behaviour are the news movies and series in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars franchises, as most fan communities of these franchises have been outraged about the new characters and story lines, where many people claimed that this \"ruined their childhood\" [@toxic_fandom].\n",
    "\n",
    "From an economic point of view, fandom and fan cultures are seen as the ideal costumers. They are eager to get their hands on the newest products and they are stable with re-occuring purchases, since intense consumption is considered a part of the fan identity [@arouh_toxic_2020].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Toxic Fan behaviour\n",
    "In the first place, toxic fandom is a buzzword, that is widely used throughout media to describe or identify fans who engage in behaviors that are considered negative or unaccaptable. This behavior can range from simple negative responses to bullying other members of a fandom or those involved in the creation of the fan object [@toxic_fandom]. Most of this behaviour can be observed online in social media, there are however reports of toxic behaviour in real-life as well, such as abusive behaviour at events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word toxic itself however is defined as \"of relating to, or caused by a toxin,\" \"of the nature of a poison; poisonous\" [@arouh_toxic_2020]. This definition originally originates from medival latin, where it refers to poisoned arrows or to being imbued with poison. Following this definition, it is an *external* substance that is toxic and not a person or their behaviour. However in recent years the understanding of this definition has shifted, today someones actions or the emotions experienced or types of character are now understood as poisonous or \"toxic\" [@arouh_toxic_2020]. This definition is closely related to the definition of the word fan, as explained earlier, fan originates from fanatic, which is traditionally linked to madness and demonic posession. This traditional and long obselete link is often exploited by media outlets to mark fans as psychopaths whose frustrated fantasies of intimate relationships or unsatisfied desires with the fan object take violent and ant-social forms [@arouh_toxic_2020]. In order to maintain this hypothesis, media often picks the most miserable and negative or \"click-bait\" examples of fan behaviour, as it creates the most attention and keeps the viewing figures high [@arouh_toxic_2020], [@proctor_editors_2018]. These circumstances are additionally amplified by social media plattforms, as they promote toxic behaviour, because it usually creates a lot of interactions. Therefore, it is our overall understanding of what a fan is that marks a him as a toxic \"other\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What is also observed, is that \"toxic\" fans often fall back to racist and mysogenistic behaviour compared with hate speech in order to defend their fan object or view point. This often comes with a feeling of \"power loss\" for the \"toxic fan\". Because of that, current social-, ideological- and political conflicts are becoming more and more frequent as a topic in toxic behaviour [@proctor_editors_2018], [@arouh_toxic_2020], [@toxic_fandom]. For some members of the fan communities, this feeling of power loss is amplified by current political circumstances where they feel a feeling of disempowerment at their loss of priviliged status in society because of gender discussions or woman rights movements. Thus toxic fans are often painted as angry white, heterosexual men or members of the \"alt-right\" community. However in many cases, fan communities are used as a plattform to spread this hatered or ideological ideas because it creates a lot of attention in social networks as well as from the media. The media then progresses to paint fandom and online culture as more and more toxic because it creates \"maximum cultural penetration\" [@proctor_editors_2018]. This trend has led to the phenomenon of *progressive toxicity*, where other fans \"rush to prove one's moral superiority by speaking out against some racist, sexist or otherwise hurtful sentiment, the sentiment is often amplified on a scale that wouldn't have been possible had people not taken the bait\" [@proctor_editors_2018]. This rush to prove morally better than the toxic other often leads to toxic behavior by the defender itself. Because of that, toxic practices more and more frequently are instantiations of larger political or cultural polarizations and they depict the current socio-political climate. Thus toxic fan behaviour is often observed as a conlflict between the \"political correct\" pro-diversity crowd, which are also called social justice warriors (SJWs) and the members of the so-called \"alt-right\" hell-bent [@proctor_editors_2018].\n",
    "\n",
    "However toxic fan behaviour is not limited to racist, misogynistic comments that can also include hate-speech. Some toxic fan are even going as far as to writing death or rape threats, doxing people (doxing refers to leaking personal information online) or to show abusive and harassing behaviour in public against other groups [@proctor_editors_2018], [@arouh_toxic_2020]."

However the api will only retrieve 50 items per request, if there are more items that fit the search query the response is paged and contains a *nextPageToken*, that can be used to obtain the next 50 items. Requesting all videos since 2020 allows the dataset to span a timeframe of three years and will allow to analyze toxicity over time as well and will also paint a broader picture of how the F1 fandom developed. After obtaining all video information, the video ids are extracted and safed into a list, which is used later to obtain the actual comment threads."

    "### Grievance Dictionary\n",
    "The Grievance Dictionary proposed by van der Vegt et. al. aims to provide a method to automatically understand language use in the context of grievance-fuelled violence threat assessement [@van_der_vegt_grievance_2021]. It has been created out of informed suggestions from experienced threat assesement practitioners in combination with subsequent humand and computational word list generation. The resulting dictionary includes 20502 words which were annotated by 2318 participants. In its validation process, it was applied to texts written by violent and non-violent individuals. The results showed strong evidence for a high classification performance [@van_der_vegt_grievance_2021].\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary itself is composed of multiple categories which depict different forms of grievance, for example jealousy or threat. Each category includes a number of word stems, annotated with weights, which indicate how important or meaningful the given word is for the category it is included in. There are two version of the dictionary available, one which includes words with weights of five or higher and one which includes words with weights of seven or higher. During this thesis the dictionary with weights higher than five will be used, as it can hypothetically cover more infrequent and domain specific words. The dictionary can support three different approaches to text classification [@van_der_vegt_grievance_2021]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportional Scoring**: Proportional scoring or wordcount-based classification, calculates the proportion of grievance fueled words in the given texts. This proportion is then used as a classification measure.\n",
    "- **Weight-based**: During this approach, the assigned word weights are used to obtain a weight average for each given text, which is used as the classification measure.\n",
    "- **Word inclusion**: Word inclusion checks if and how often the given words from the dictionary are included in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to analyse the dataset with the grievance dictionary, all comment texts have to be stemmed. For that, the Porterstemmer, word_tokenize and TreebankWordDetokenizer from the natural language toolkit will be used. First, the comment dataset will be copied, this ensures, that the original texts won't be affected by the applied dictionary specific processing. Then, the text column will be manipulated through the swifter module, which ensures efficient and automatic parrallelization. During manipulation, the text is split up into tokens, then converted to its word stem by the Porterstemmer and detokenized by the TreebankWordDetokenizer. This process essentially converts the original text into the same text sequence but it is composed of word stems instead of the actual words."

It is then injected into the decoder stack, which generates a new text sequence, based of already generated characters and the embedding from the encoders [@vaswani_attention_2017]. Today, many variations of the original transformer architecture exist, some are only using the encoder stack, while others only use the decoder stack.

Even though this is not a direct classification of typical toxic behaviour like racism or hate speech as sorrow text will also be classified as negative, it still hints towards the overall sentiment inside Formula 1 fandom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text-classification transformer used in this thesis is the \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\" [@distilbert_sentiment] model. It is a fine-tuned version of the \"DistilBERT-base-uncased\" on the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank corpus) [@sst-2] for sentiment classification. The model has been validated on SST-2 as, well as on the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark)[@wang2019glue]. On both Datasets, the model reaches scores over 0.9 (1 being the highest possible score) across the board, with scores around 0.98 in all metrics for sentiment classification [@distilbert_sentiment]. However it can only work with english text. Besides the proven classification performance, the model can produce biased predictions. As an example, in this map (taken from: [@distilbert_sentiment]):\n",
    "![prediction_map](./images/map.jpeg)\n",
    "the prediction scores for producing a positive sentiment per *country name* are depicted. It can be observed, that the probabilisty vary drastically between different countries. It has been shown, that for the sentence \"This film was filmed in COUNTRY\", \"France\" will produce a positive label with a probability of 0.89 but \"Afghanistan\" will only produce a positive label with a probability of 0.08, even though nothig in the text hinted at a semantic shift [@distilbert_sentiment]. As these kind of models are trained unsupervised, this is an unintentional side-effect. Nonetheless, the model is a powerful, reliable and well tested sentiment classifier and will thus be used during this thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english are models like the \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest\" [@tweet_sentiment_classifier] model, that has been trained to classifiy tweets this included working with emojis, irony, offensive language and hatespeech, which would in theory be a better fit for the domain of this research. However, the model has been shown to produce scores around 0.65 or lower, which is comparatively low for sentiment classification tasks. Besides that, no bias analysis has been done on the model or the train dataset [@tweet_sentiment_classifier], which poses a risk in using this model, especially as twitter has been shown to be a plattform that includes a lot of toxicity and hateful content [arouh_toxic_2020]. In addition to that, the tokenizer of the model has been trained without a truncation token (\\[TRUNC\\]), which is used to trim text sequences that are longer than the supported maximum length of the model. In the initial release, this hasn't been a problem as the average tweet in the dataset is reported to be 100 tokens long, and the models maximum length is at 512 tokens. However, the Youtube comments included in the acquired dataset have often shown to produce longer sequences than 512 tokens and thus are in need to use the truncation token. But, using the truncation token produces a vocabulary length mismatch between the tokenizer and the model, which leads to the model crashing during processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english the common \"Huggingface\", also called \"pytorch-transformers\" library is used. It enables fast and easy access to hundreds of models available on the Huggingface model hub. First up, the tokenizer, config and model are initialized with the pre-trained weights available on the model hub for the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model. Now every comment is fed sequentially into the model by first encoding it with the tokenizer and then passing the encoded input through the actual transformer model. This will return a tensor with classification information as well as further metadata. The classification data is extracted from the model und run through a softmax to obtain the actual prediction scores for the classes, which are represented by their vector positions. The vector is then sorted via an argsort to obtain the highest vector position, which is converted into the actual label. Both the score and the label are then appended to a score and label list, which are injected into the global data frame at the end of the processing loop."

    "The second transformer classifier used during this thesis is the \"Hate-speech-CNERG/dehatebert-mono-english\" transformer. It aims to classify into hate speech containing texts and texts without hate speech [@hate_speech_classifier]. As hate speech is part of content that is considered toxic, the classification results are a direct indicator if Formula 1 fandom is toxic or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a derivative of the BERT transformer family and can only work with english texts [@hate_speech_classifier]. It has been trained on a combined dataset from 6 publicly available hate speech datasets, which include examples from sources like Twitter and Stormfront. During validation and testing, the model achieved a score of 0.71, with that being the highest score reached over all models tested. It has been shown, that it performs best in high ressource settings, where the dataset has to contain more then 256 datapoints. During model development, Aluru et. al. conducted research into trying to understand based on which text fragments, the model makes it predictions. This research suggested, that the model is not heavily influenced by the presence of certain keywords, it rather looks for the context in which the words appear in [@hate_speech_classifier]. Thus, verbs like hunt or expel are receiving higher attention values from the model, then a direct insult. However, the presence of a verb which could be bad is not enough to lead the model to classify text as hate, only if a verb is paired with an insult or a direct target or in other words if the context fits, the model will predict hateful content. As an example, \"Mexicans are f\\*\\*king great people\" will be classified as non-hate even though it contains the word f\\*\\*ck. However, \"I f\\*\\*king hate ni\\*\\*ers!\" will be classified as hate speech. In addition to that, the model can understand internet obscurtions in insults, such as \"f\\*\\*ck\". It can also connect text sequences to background knowledge, such that \"6 million was not enough. Next time ovens will be the last of your concerns\" will be classified as hate speech, even though no insult or direct attack was given [@hate_speech_classifier]. The model however is able to understand the unmentioned target of the sequence in this case jews and that it relates to the crueltys during the holocaust in germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the actual implementation, the same process as for the sentiment classifier is reused, as only the model id needs to be changed and model weights etc. will be loaded automatically."

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the Grievance Dictionary, a psycholinguistic dictionary that can be used to automatically understand language use in the context of grievance-fueled violence threat assessment. We describe the development of the dictionary, which was informed by suggestions from experienced threat assessment practitioners. These suggestions and subsequent human and computational word list generation resulted in a dictionary of 20,502 words annotated by 2318 participants. The dictionary was validated by applying it to texts written by violent and non-violent individuals, showing strong evidence for a difference between populations in several dictionary categories. Further classification tasks showed promising performance, but future improvements are still needed. Finally, we provide instructions and suggestions for the use of the Grievance Dictionary by security professionals and (violence) researchers.",
