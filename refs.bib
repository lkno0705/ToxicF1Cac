	abstract = {Participation in online fandoms of popular culture has become today a mainstream activity, receiving much scholarly and industry attention. This attention has been both positive and negative, at certain times praising the enthusiasm and innovation of fans, while at other times criticizing toxic practices deemed disruptive and destructive. This paper reviews what is generally termed as “toxic fans,” in an effort to explicate its meaning as well as its underlying moral framing. Specifically, the etymology of the word toxic is considered so as to explain how it is used in current discourse about online fan culture. Following this discussion, it is argued that the nature of fan practices should be closely studied in relation to prevalent attitudes in contemporary society that are defined by fear and a certain “othering” of the online fanatic. Finally, the ambivalent nature of the word toxic is discussed in relation to the antagonism usually observed in producer/fan relations as these are conducted in online spaces.},

We describe the development of the dictionary, which was informed by suggestions from experienced threat assessment practitioners. These suggestions and subsequent human and computational word list generation resulted in a dictionary of 20,502 words annotated by 2318 participants. The dictionary was validated by applying it to texts written by violent and non-violent individuals, showing strong evidence for a difference between populations in several dictionary categories. Further classification tasks showed promising performance, but future improvements are still needed. Finally, we provide instructions and suggestions for the use of the Grievance Dictionary by security professionals and (violence) researchers.},

	abstract = {The following is a list of ethnic slurs or ethnophaulisms or ethnic epithets that are, or have been, used as insinuations or allegations about members of a given ethnicity or racial group or to refer to them in a derogatory, pejorative, or otherwise insulting manner.
Some of the terms listed below (such as "gringo", "yank", etc.) can be used in casual speech without any intention of causing offense. The connotation of a term and prevalence of its use as a pejorative or neutral descriptor varies over time and by geography.
For the purposes of this list, an ethnic slur is a term designed to insult others on the basis of race, ethnicity, or nationality. Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and a reference to that term.
Ethnic slurs may also be produced as a racial epithet by combining a general-purpose insult with the name of ethnicity, such as "dirty Jew", "Russian pig", etc. Other common insulting modifiers include "dog", "filthy", etc. However, such terms are not included in this list.},
